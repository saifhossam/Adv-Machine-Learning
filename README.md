# Medical Data Analysis with Machine Learning

This project applies **machine learning techniques** to analyze a medical dataset. It includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a simple GUI for user interaction**.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Uses `pandas` for data handling and `sklearn.preprocessing` for transformations.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements decision trees for classification.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses metrics like accuracy to assess model performance.
- **GUI Interface**: Uses `tkinter` to create an interactive user interface.

## Installation
